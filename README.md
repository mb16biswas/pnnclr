# pNNCLR: Stochastic Pseudo Neighborhoods for Contrastive Learning based Unsupervised Representation Learning Problems

* Pseudo nearest neighbors (pNN) improve the learning of nearest neighbor based contrastive learning methods

* A pNN based method called pNNCLR is proposed to improve upon baseline NNCLR.
  
* Addition of noise to the sampling algorithm increases the semantic information.

* A smooth-weight-updation approach in nearest neighbor based contrastive learning methods is highly useful in controlling the uncertainty in sampling
